# autho: An Authorization Server

`autho` is a flexible and extensible authorization server built in Clojure. It provides a RESTful API to manage access control policies and evaluate authorization requests, making it easy to integrate with other services to secure your applications.

The core of `autho` is a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that evaluates incoming requests against a set of policies to determine if access should be granted or denied. Policies are defined using a simple JSON-based rule language.

## Features

*   **Centralized Authorization:** Manage authorization logic in a single service.
*   **Policy-Based Access Control:** Define fine-grained access control policies.
*   **REST API:** Easy to integrate with any application that can make HTTP requests.
*   **Delegation of Rights:** Users can delegate their access rights to other users.
*   **Extensible:** Connect to various attribute sources like databases or LDAP to enrich authorization requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java (version 8 or later)
*   [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) (the Clojure build tool)

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd autho
    ```

2.  **Build the standalone JAR:**
    ```bash
    lein uberjar
    ```
    This will create a file named `autho-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` in the `target/uberjar` directory.

3.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    java -jar target/uberjar/autho-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
    ```
    The server will start on port 8080 by default.
